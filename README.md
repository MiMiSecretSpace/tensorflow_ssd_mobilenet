## TLDR

This training is based on Tensorflow Object Detection API and Tensorflow version 2. Before start training, API installation is needed, link to the official [github](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection) to find the installation guide. 

After API installed, please prepare pre-train model and training data. You can find pre-train model on official [model zoo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/tf2_detection_zoo.md) or third party model. About training data, we generated it on [roboflow](https://roboflow.com/) you can also use other method to generate it.
